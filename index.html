					<h3>Who are we?</h3>
					<p>
						We're a community that likes to have fun and collaborate together. We have a small and curated selection of staff who are willing to help out in any given circumstance. We only have two banned items on our server (Dimensional Anchor and World Anchor) and we plan to keep it this way for a while. Our server plugins are non-invasive and are as minimal as possible to ensure the best quality gameplay. We strive to encourage creativity and appreciate our players. We're looking forward to seeing you soon!

					<h3>Plugins</h3>
					<p>
						Our plugins are as minimally invasive as we could possibly make them. The plugins we use are AutoMessage, AutoRank, ChestShop, Essentials, Factions, LWC, and Vault. This list is subject to change.

					<h3>Banned Items</h3>
					<p>
						Our only banned items are the World Anchor and Dimensional Anchor. They tend to cause lag by keeping chunks where players are not present running in the background.
